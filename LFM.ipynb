    "\n",
    "LFM methods based on user behaviors (data itself) represent users' personal opinions towards the classification of items. LFM methods have the similar key ideas compared with ItemCF: Two items, if they are clicked, watched, or liked by many users, there's a pretty good chance to classify those two items into same class/genere.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decide the number of final classes/generes\n",

    "\n",
    "- The weight of each class/genere\n",
    "\n",
    "LFM will generate the weight of each class/genere, and thus LFM can learn which class that item belongs to. 'Soft' classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Different dimensions for different classes\n",
    "\n",
    "According to user profile or user preference, classes computed by LFM are not in the same dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decide the weight of one item in one class\n",
    "\n",
    "The weight will be large if that item can represent that class (the attribute). For example, if users in one class almost have high chances to click or love one item, that item could have high weight in that class.\n",

    "For each user, we know the number of times the user click on public accounts or video, and we also know the number of times they save, or the duration length they watch the video. Thus, we compute the $interest$ including the $weights$ for given user $i$ and item(public account or video link) $i$ to be the user's click/action frequency level of that item and normalized by user's total click or watch:\n",
